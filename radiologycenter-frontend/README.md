# Frontend Folder Structure Proposal

To modernize and scale the frontend, consider restructuring as follows:

```
src/
  features/
    patients/
      PatientList.jsx
      PatientForm.jsx
      patientService.js
      ...
    appointments/
      AppointmentList.jsx
      AppointmentForm.jsx
      appointmentService.js
      ...
    ...
  components/
    common/
      Button.jsx
      Input.jsx
      Modal.jsx
      Toast.jsx
      ...
    layout/
      Navbar.jsx
      Sidebar.jsx
      ...
  hooks/
    useModal.js
    useAuth.js
    ...
  context/
    AuthContext.jsx
    ToastContext.jsx
    ...
  utils/
    config.js
    ...
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
  index.css
```

**Key Points:**
- Group by feature/domain for scalability.
- Place shared UI elements in `components/common/`.
- Keep layout components in `components/layout/`.
- Keep hooks, context, and utils at the root for easy access.
- Each feature folder contains its own components and services.

This structure improves maintainability, scalability, and developer experience.
