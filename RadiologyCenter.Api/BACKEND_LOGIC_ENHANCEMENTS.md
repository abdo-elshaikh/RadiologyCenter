This document summarizes suggested improvements to the backend service layer logic to improve maintainability, security, and scalability.

---

## AppointmentService

- Use Unit of Work or transaction scope to ensure atomicity when updating appointments and related payments.
- Avoid fetching all payments in memory; add repository methods to query payments by appointment ID.
- Decouple payment creation/refund logic using domain events or messaging.
- Add logging for key operations and exceptions.
- Validate input DTOs more thoroughly.
- Use cancellation tokens in async methods.
- Add XML documentation for public methods.

## AuthService

- Implement account lockout on multiple failed login attempts.
- Add email confirmation and password reset flows.
- Enforce stronger password policies (e.g., minimum length 8, special characters).
- Add logging for registration and password change events.
- Implement JWT token refresh mechanism.
- Use cancellation tokens in async methods.
- Add XML documentation for public methods.

---

Implementing these improvements will enhance the robustness, security, and maintainability of the backend services.

# Backend Logic Enhancement Suggestions for RadiologyCenter API

This document summarizes suggested improvements to the backend service layer logic to improve maintainability, security, and scalability.

## AppointmentService

- Use Unit of Work or transaction scope to ensure atomicity when updating appointments and related payments. Implemented using repository transaction in UpdateAsync.
- Avoid fetching all payments in memory; added repository method GetPaymentByAppointmentIdAsync in AccountingService and used it in AppointmentService.
- Decouple payment creation/refund logic using domain events or messaging. (Consider for future improvement)
- Added logging for key operations and exceptions in AppointmentService.
- Validated input DTOs for null and initialized collections.
- Added cancellation tokens in async methods.
- Added XML documentation for public methods.

## AuthService

- Implement account lockout on multiple failed login attempts.
- Add email confirmation and password reset flows.
- Enforce stronger password policies (e.g., minimum length 8, special characters).
- Add logging for registration and password change events.
- Implement JWT token refresh mechanism.
- Use cancellation tokens in async methods.
- Add XML documentation for public methods.
